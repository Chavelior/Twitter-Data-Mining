# Twitter-Data-Mining

Twitter Application Development : Aim to use Serach API part of REST API. Work with twitteR package library vignette.Query for tweets with related keywords and hashtags. Mind the limitation of search API, it can give only limited numberof tweets per day. Group the tweets by geo-location as in Google Maps API and plot on USA Map.

Compare the results with cDC website results.
